# Urbanography photo gallery: ***Graffiti Gallery***

## Description:

Portraying with exuberance and fascination a small set of images arranged in a virtual gallery, the 'Graffiti Gallery' is a project that enhances urban graphics as art.
The work was conceived in order to demonstrate the stylization of a page, and at the same time to study the syntax and application of the
"SASS", using its "variables" and "mixins" as the "CSS" extension language.
If you want to practice using "SASS" in its indented form, studying the features that add, facilitate and simplify the development process, feel free to clone this repository and test your skills.
Do not waste time! Access the 'Graffiti Gallery' now by clicking on the link (https://graffitigallery.netlify.app/) to enjoy the vividness of the colors and the graphic style of the images... Enjoy!
